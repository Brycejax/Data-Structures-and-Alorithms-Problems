## Notes on Graphs - there are no built in python Graphs

---
directed/undirected Graphs - describes a system which is directioonal or bidirectional

directed - one way
undirected - two way (back and forth access)

weighted/unweighted - does the graph have cost between each node?

weighted - each edge in the graph has a cost to travel to the next node
unweighted - the cost to travel from node to node is free

Cyclic/Acyclic

cyclic - a graph that has vertices that create a cycle

acyclic - a graph that does not create a cycle

3 different ways to represent a graph
    - Edge list
    - Adjacency list
    - Adjacency Matrix <- my favorite choice
