## There is not a built in DS for linked list within python below are notes instead

---

two types of linked lists - singly and doubly

singly vs doubly

singly - 
    pros: simple implimentation - lesser memory - slightly faster
    cons: cannot iterate in reverse
          if we lose the head - the whole list can be lost in memort

doubly -
    pros: we can delete a previous node from the tail or the head
    cons: more memory in storage, more operations, and more complex
